##GPS 1.1 Reflection##
*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*

I was having trouble with understand the branches and pull requests. 

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*

I had a better understanding of the Git workflow and of the pull requests interface. 

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*

I asked about files/folders and how git treats them differently in regard to pushing to origin ect. 

*What still confuses you about Git?*

I am feeling confident in my Git abilities at the moment but I still have trouble remembering commands and I want to be sure to delete branches and be careful in my merging. 

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*

It was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it. Thank you
